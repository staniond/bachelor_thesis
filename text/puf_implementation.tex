The goal of this chapter is to find a suitable mechanism for \gls{sram} power state control on the ESP32 microcontroller. Two different methods are presented and their result (the startup memory values used as a \gls{puf} response) are analyzed. 

First, an analysis based on temperature and \gls{sram} power off-time is performed. The temperature is controlled by a temperature chamber Binder MK-56obj. It is capable of producing temperatures from -40 °C to +180 °C\cite{Binder2021}. However, only the range of -40 °C to +70 °C is used for the analysis as higher temperatures could potentially damage the components. This analysis is performed mainly to understand the data retention time of the \gls{sram} and set adequate minimum interval the memory needs to stay off before extracting the response.

Then, some of the \gls{puf} parameters defined in Section~\ref{sec:puf_evaluation} are used to evaluate the results. A summary for both power state control methods is provided at the end, discussing their advantages, disadvantages and viability of use.

Only the original ESP32 microcontroller model is used. Sixteen pieces will be measured and are numbered \gls{mcu} 1 to \gls{mcu} 16. All of the measurements were captured under normal voltage conditions.

\section{RTC SRAM based PUF}
%--------------------------------

The first method of \gls{sram} power control is to use the \gls{rtc} part of \gls{sram} memory on ESP32. This part of memory can be switched on and off using the \gls{rtc} power domain controller.
%The memory layout of the microcontroller was described in Section~\ref{sec:memory_layout}.
 
\subsection{RTC SRAM power control}

The ESP32 has the ability to power-control parts of its chip. This feature can be used to save power while some of the components of the microcontroller are not being used. WiFi, digital core, internal \gls{sram} and \gls{rtc} \gls{sram} can all be power-controlled. This seems like an ideal mechanism for implementing the \gls{sram} \gls{puf} as the memory can be turned off and on during runtime with little time overhead.

All of the individual \gls{sram} sections (SRAM 0, 1 and 2, \gls{rtc} FAST \gls{sram} and \gls{rtc} SLOW \gls{sram}, described in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:memory_layout}) can be power-controlled individually. One of the sections therefore needs to be selected for the \gls{puf} implementation.

At first, the logical \gls{sram} section to select would be the \gls{sram} 0, 1 or 2, as they have a large capacity (all three more than 100 KB). However, all of the data saved in the selected section would be lost during response extraction (the memory needs to be turned off). This would prohibit this chunk of memory from being used and potentially render some memory hungry applications impossible to be implemented. Additionally, the ESP-IDF toolchain would need to be adjusted to not use this part of memory. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \label{fig:rtc_register}
\end{figure}

Because of these drawbacks, the \gls{rtc} FAST \gls{sram} section was selected. Since it is also used to store program instructions (the deep sleep wake stub) and data (dynamic heap allocations), it needs to be preserved during response extraction. This can be done by backing up the whole 8 KB section of memory to the main \gls{sram} before power down and restoring it afterwards. This is not possible with the main \gls{sram} sections because of their size.

The power state of the FAST \gls{rtc} \gls{sram} is controlled by the \gls{rtc} domain power management register. Functions of the individual register bits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rtc_register}. Bits number 13 (RTC\_CNTL\_FASTMEM\_FORCE\_PU)\footnote{RTC\_CNTL\_FASTMEM\_FORCE\_PD = \gls{rtc} control fast memory force power up} and 12 (RTC\_CNTL\_FASTMEM\_FORCE\_PD)\footnote{RTC\_CNTL\_FASTMEM\_FORCE\_PD = \gls{rtc} control fast memory force power down} are important. They can be set to control the power state of the memory.

\subsection{SRAM analysis based on temperature and power-off time}\label{sec:rtc_analysis}

Data remanence of the \gls{rtc} FAST \gls{sram}, power controlled using the above described method, is analyzed in this section. Several experiments for each \gls{mcu} have been conducted according to this algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set ambient temperature to a desired value.
    \item Initialize memory to a default value.\footnote{In the presented experiments, the default value was `0' for all bits. However, measurements with bits initialized to `1' showed nearly identical results.}
    \item Turn memory off for a set interval and then turned it on again.
    \item Observe the contents of memory.
    \item Continue from step 2. with increased turn off interval until enough data is collected.
\end{enumerate}

Observing the contents of memory in this case means calculating the percentage of bits that flipped to a different state while turned off. For the default initial state of `0', this is equivalent to calculating the percentage Hamming weight of the bit string (counting the `1' bits).

The expected result is that, at the beginning for a very small turn off interval, no bits will flip. The biggest interval under which no bits flip is the \emph{data remanence time}. With increasing turn off interval, more and more bits start to flip. The percentage of flipped bits should stabilize around 50\% which is the ideal value of uniformity. At this point, all data previously saved in memory should be lost and the contents of memory after power up should depend only on the preferred initial state of the memory cells. The smallest interval under which this happens will be called the \emph{fade out time}. The \gls{sram} \gls{puf} implementation should set the turn off interval to a greater value than is the maximum \emph{fade out time} of the \gls{sram} under varying conditions (such as temperature or voltage). This prevents data remanence from affecting the \gls{puf} response.

Results of the first experiment are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:all_plus_20_rtc}. The graph shows the percentage of flipped bits in 20 °C with the turn off interval ranging from 0 to 1000 $\mu{}S$. The results are as expected. The \emph{data remanence time} is around 180 $\mu{}S$, the \emph{fade out time} is around 900 $\mu{}S$ and the percentage of flipped bits stabilizes around 50\% for all \glspl{mcu}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]

    \caption{Percentage of flipped bits of all MCUs in 20 °C.}
    \label{fig:all_plus_20_rtc}
\end{figure}


The second experiment shows the behavior of one \gls{mcu} (number 6 was chosen but results for the others are similar) across the whole range of -40 to +70 °C. The graph can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:6_across_temps_rtc}. As expected, the lower temperatures increase the \emph{data remanence time} and the \emph{fade out time} significantly and higher temperatures decrease them. However, for the lower temperatures (below 0 °C), the \emph{fade out time} cannot be seen as the memory did not have enough time to stabilize yet. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering,margin=0.5cm}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/6_across_temps_rtc.png}
    \caption{Percentage of flipped bits of MCU 6 across a range of temperatures.}
    \label{fig:6_across_temps_rtc}
\end{figure}

The next experiment therefore looks at the behavior of all \glspl{mcu} in -20 °C. The turn off interval was significantly increased to 50 000 $\mu{}S$. The results are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:all_minus_20_rtc}. A very strange behavior can be seen. It looks as if the memory does not fade out at all, only a limited number of bits flip and the rest of the bits retain their original state. Furthermore, for each board a wildly different number of bits flip in this temperature. Nearly no bits flip for \gls{mcu} 4, but about 33 percent of bits flip for \gls{mcu} 6.\footnote{Note the values on the Y axis of the graph, they do not even reach 50 \%.}

This was confirmed by extending the range of the turn off interval to 1 S and then to 100 S. The number of flipped bits does not change anymore with increased turn off time and the memory `freezes'. In -40 °C only about 1 \% of bits flip no matter the turn off interval for each \gls{mcu}. The initial value of the memory cell does not matter either, `0' and `1' states both freeze in the same way. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering,margin=0.5cm}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/all_minus_20_rtc.png}
    \caption{Percentage of flipped bits of all MCUs in -20 °C.}
    \label{fig:all_minus_20_rtc}
\end{figure}

A possible explanation of this behavior can be following. All transistors leak current even if they are switched off. This is called a leakage current. A transistor that works as a switch for turning the \gls{rtc} FAST \gls{sram} on and off has a leakage current which is high enough that the memory is able to retain its state in low temperatures. \gls{sram} memory draws very little power while only retaining data---no read/write operations are taking place and thus the logical states of the circuit do not change. This is called the static \gls{cmos} power dissipation. It has been shown by \cite{Kocanda2015} that the static power dissipation is highly influenced by temperature. A change of temperature from 100 to 20 °C decreases the power draw by a factor of 3 to 83, depending on the exact \gls{cmos} technology used.

As is evident from the Figure~\ref{fig:all_minus_20_rtc}, different \glspl{mcu} freeze at different rates---the percentage of bit flips varies wildly across \glspl{mcu}. This supports this hypothesis as the leakage current of the transistor is probably also influenced by the random variations during the manufacturing process.

This can explain the `freezing' effect of memory in low temperatures. However, this explanation could not be confirmed.

\subsection{PUF evaluation parameters}\label{sec:rtc_evaluation}

Since the evaluation parameters require \gls{puf} responses for their calculation, they need to be obtained. The response was chosen to be a 4 KB bit string of the (first half of) \gls{rtc} FAST \gls{sram}. Only one response is extracted, no memory address based challenge system was considered because of the limited size of the used memory region (8 KB). The turn off interval was set to 100 000 $\mu{}S$. This a lot higher value than the \emph{fade out time} of the memory for warmer temperatures (above 0 °C). There is no point in considering lower temperatures since the memory freezes while using this power control technique. The reference response was calculated using a bitwise average of 1000 measured responses.

\subsubsection*{Uniformity}

Uniformity of all \glspl{mcu} in different temperatures can be seen in Table~\ref{table:uniformity_rtc_sram}. The values look very good in temperatures above 10 °C, hovering around the desired value of 50 \%. However, in lower temperatures, the effect of memory freezing can be seen clearly. The values plummet and hit nearly 0 \% in -40 °C. This is due to the choice of default initial value of `0' bits. Uniformity rises towards 100 \% if the default value is a `1' bit.

\subsubsection*{Reliability}

Reliability values of all \glspl{mcu} in different temperatures are displayed in Table~\ref{table:reliability_rtc_sram}. The reference response used for the calculations was obtained in 20°C.

Once again, the values look good in temperatures above 10 °C, being fairly close to the ideal 100 \%. The highest reliability can be observed in 20 °C. This is the result of the reference response being calculated in this temperature. The effect of freezing is once again evident in low temperatures. Reliability goes down toward 50 \%, which is the worst possible value.\footnote{The value of 0 \% would mean that the response bits are just inverted compared to the reference.}

\subsubsection*{Uniqueness}

Uniqueness of the responses from different \glspl{mcu} across the whole range of temperatures is shown in Table~\ref{table:uniqueness_rtc_sram}. Again, the values look good in temperatures above 0 °C, attacking the ideal of 50 \%. However, in lower temperatures uniqueness plummets rapidly as the responses start to freeze. Since the initial value of memory is the same across the \glspl{mcu}, the data remanence kicks in and the responses start to become more and more alike.

\subsection{Summary}
% ze tohle jde jen na puvodnim ESP32 a single coru, protoze ostatni maji jiny rezim
As is evident from the experiments, this power control method can only be used in temperatures above 10 °C. The exact temperature where the memory starts to freeze also differs for each \gls{mcu}.

Moreover, only the original ESP32 and the ESP32-S2 (the single core version) microcontrollers have the functionality to power-control the memory sections. In the newer models, this functionality was replaced by the `retention' mode of memory. This mode enables the memory to retain its data while no read/write operations need to take place, saving power in the process.\cite{esp322021} Thus, this method cannot be applied to the newer models.

On the other side, the ability to power-control the memory during runtime is very powerful. The response can be extracted on demand quickly, because the whole device does not need to be powered down and then up which is an extremely time consuming process.
