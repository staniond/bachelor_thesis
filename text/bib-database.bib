An unambiguous definition for each of the discussed properties is presented, and a comparative study on a representative subset of PUF proposals identifies the truly PUF-defining characteristics. The second part of this chapter presents the details of a very formal framework for describing PUFs and related physical primitives in a cryptographic manner. This allows cryptographers to use PUFs more easily as building blocks in theoretical constructions, while simultaneously enabling hardware designers and engineers to build constructions which actually comply with this framework.",

    abstract = {Physically unclonable functions or PUFs are innovative physical security primitives which produce unclonable and inherent instance-specific measurements of physical objects; PUFs are in many ways the inanimate equivalent of biometrics for human beings. Since they are able to securely generate and store secrets, PUFs allow to bootstrap the physical implementation of an information security system. In this thesis, we discuss PUFs in all their facets: the multitude of their physical constructions, the algorithmic and physical properties which describe them, and the techniques required to deploy them in security applications. We present our contributions on each of these aspects.We first give an unprecedented extensive overview and classification of PUF constructions, with a focus on intrinsic PUFs. We identify significant subclasses, implementation properties and general design techniques used to amplify sub-microscopic physical distinctions into observable digital response vectors. We list the useful properties attributed to PUFs and capture them in descriptive yet clear definitions. Through an elaborate comparative analysis, we distinguish truly PUF-defining properties from nice-to-have but not strictly required qualities. Additionally, we describe a formal framework for deploying PUFs and similar physical primitives in cryptographic reductions.In order to objectively compare the quality of different PUF constructions, we contributed to the development of a silicon test platform carrying six different intrinsic PUF structures. Based on experimental data from 192 distinct test devices, including measurements at temperature and supply voltage corner cases, we assess the reliability, the uniqueness and the unpredictability of each of these constructions and summarize them in concise yet meaningful statistics.Their instance-specific and unclonable nature enables to use PUFs as entity identifiers. In combination with appropriate processing algorithms, they can even authenticate entities and securely generate and store secrets. We present new techniques to achieve PUF-based entity identification, entity authentication, and secure key generation. We additionally propose practical designs implementing these techniques, and derive and calculate meaningful measures for assessing the performance of different PUF constructions in these applications based on the quality of their response statistics. Finally, as a proof of concept, we present a fully functional prototype implementation of a PUF-based cryptographic key generator, demonstrating the full benefit of using PUFs and the efficiency of the introduced processing techniques.},

In this paper, we propose new protocols for the IP protection problem on FPGAs and provide the first construction of a PUF intrinsic to current FPGAs based on SRAM memory randomness present on current FPGAs.

        abstract = {Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have emerged as a promising primitive that can be used to provide a hardware root of trust for integrated circuit (IC) applications. PUFs exploit the random intrinsic manufacturing process variations that map a set of challenges to a set of responses. The mapping of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) is unique and random to each PUF instance, which makes PUFs a very promising technology for robust security devices. PUFs have been proposed for lightweight IC identification and authentication, and cryptographic key generation. However, as CMOS technology scales down, device ageing becomes more pronounced and introduces reliability issues for PUF circuits. When PUFs undergo ageing, the response changes. As a consequence, the trustworthy identity of the ICs can be violated. The area overhead of an error correction code (ECC) in a PUF-based system needed to generate error-free cryptographic keys also increases. Furthermore, a PUF is physically unclonable but its function is susceptible to modelling attacks from machine learning (ML) techniques. Therefore, providing reliable and secure PUFs for lightweight applications is a major challenge. This thesis studies the reliability of PUFs for lightweight applications under ageing. It also considers the susceptibility of PUFs to ML-based attacks. This thesis presents three major contributions. The context of the first and second contributions is within the lightweight IC {\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}identification and authentication, and the third contribution is within the cryptographic key generation. The first contribution presents an analysis of the impact of ageing on PUF-based differential architectures. The simulation results demonstrate that a differential design technique to build a PUF can be a mechanism to mitigate the first-order dependencies of ageing such as the duty{\ensuremath{<}}br/{\ensuremath{>}}cycle and supply voltage. The second contribution proposes a challenge permutation technique to increase the complexity of the CRP mapping. The technique has been implemented on an Arbiter-PUF using a TSMC 65-nm technology. The simulation results show that using a challenge permutation technique can alter the output transition probability of Arbiter-PUF, resulting in the reduction of its predictability from 99\% to 65\%. The challenge permutation technique introduces no extra overhead as it can be implemented by routing obfuscation. Finally, the third contribution proposes a bit selection technique in a dual use of SRAM as a memory and PUF to mitigate the ageing impact and reduce the area overhead of the ECC. The results show that the proposed technique can effectively reduce the bit errors due to ageing and the area overhead of the ECC is reduced by about 6 times compared to that without bit selection.}

We show that against all odds, enough randomness exists in such elements when implemented on an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to turn the responses of a number of D flip-flops into a secret random sequence allowing to derive keys for use in conjunction with cryptographic algorithms. In addition to being unpredictable, these flip-flops have the advantage that they can be spread over random locations in an ASIC. This makes them very difficult to reverse-engineer when used to hide a secret key in a design at a relatively small cost in resources.},

The protocol exploits the recursive invocation of the PUF embedded on the devices to generate sequences (chains) of values that are used to achieve synchronization among communicating parties. We demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions, PHEMAP is secure and robust against man-in-the-middle attacks and other common physical attacks. We discuss PHEMAP performance in several operation conditions, by measuring the efficiency of the protocol when varying some of the underlying parameters. Finally, we present an implementation of PHEMAP on devices hosting an FPGA belonging to the Xilinx Zynq-7000 family and embedding an Anderson PUF architecture, and show that the computation and hardware overhead introduced by the protocol makes it feasible for commercial mid-range devices.}

A fully functional reference implementation is developed and successfully evaluated on a substantial set of FPGA devices. It uses a highly optimized ring oscillator PUF (ROPUF) design, producing responses with up to 99{\%} entropy. A very high key reliability is guaranteed by a syndrome construction secure sketch using an efficient and extremely low-overhead BCH decoder. This first complete implementation of a PUF-based key generator, including a PUF, a BCH decoder and a cryptographic entropy accumulator, utilizes merely 17{\%} (1162slices) of the available resources on a low-end FPGA, of which 82{\%} are occupied by the ROPUF and only 18{\%} by the key generation logic. PUFKY is able to produce a cryptographically secure 128-bit key with a failure rate <{\thinspace}10−{\thinspace}9 in 5.62ms. The design's modularity allows for rapid and scalable adaptations for other PUF implementations or for alternative key requirements.

Unfortunately, commonly used one-way functions are either based on unproven conjectures or have known vulnerabilities. We show that instead of relying on number theory, the mesoscopic physics of coherent transport through a disordered medium can be used to allocate and authenticate unique identifiers by physically reducing the medium's microstructure to a fixed-length string of binary digits. These physical one-way functions are inexpensive to fabricate, prohibitively difficult to duplicate, admit no compact mathematical representation, and are intrinsically tamper-resistant. We provide an authentication protocol based on the enormous address space that is a principal characteristic of physical one-way functions.},
