    abstract="In the first part of this chapter, the author discusses all the security-related qualities attributed to PUF constructions over time and investigates to what extent these are inherent PUF-related properties, or merely advantages of one particular type of PUF. An unambiguous definition for each of the discussed properties is presented, and a comparative study on a representative subset of PUF proposals identifies the truly PUF-defining characteristics. The second part of this chapter presents the details of a very formal framework for describing PUFs and related physical primitives in a cryptographic manner. This allows cryptographers to use PUFs more easily as building blocks in theoretical constructions, while simultaneously enabling hardware designers and engineers to build constructions which actually comply with this framework.",

    abstract = {Physically unclonable functions or PUFs are innovative physical security primitives which produce unclonable and inherent instance-specific measurements of physical objects; PUFs are in many ways the inanimate equivalent of biometrics for human beings. Since they are able to securely generate and store secrets, PUFs allow to bootstrap the physical implementation of an information security system. In this thesis, we discuss PUFs in all their facets: the multitude of their physical constructions, the algorithmic and physical properties which describe them, and the techniques required to deploy them in security applications. We present our contributions on each of these aspects.We first give an unprecedented extensive overview and classification of PUF constructions, with a focus on intrinsic PUFs. We identify significant subclasses, implementation properties and general design techniques used to amplify sub-microscopic physical distinctions into observable digital response vectors. We list the useful properties attributed to PUFs and capture them in descriptive yet clear definitions. Through an elaborate comparative analysis, we distinguish truly PUF-defining properties from nice-to-have but not strictly required qualities. Additionally, we describe a formal framework for deploying PUFs and similar physical primitives in cryptographic reductions.In order to objectively compare the quality of different PUF constructions, we contributed to the development of a silicon test platform carrying six different intrinsic PUF structures. Based on experimental data from 192 distinct test devices, including measurements at temperature and supply voltage corner cases, we assess the reliability, the uniqueness and the unpredictability of each of these constructions and summarize them in concise yet meaningful statistics.Their instance-specific and unclonable nature enables to use PUFs as entity identifiers. In combination with appropriate processing algorithms, they can even authenticate entities and securely generate and store secrets. We present new techniques to achieve PUF-based entity identification, entity authentication, and secure key generation. We additionally propose practical designs implementing these techniques, and derive and calculate meaningful measures for assessing the performance of different PUF constructions in these applications based on the quality of their response statistics. Finally, as a proof of concept, we present a fully functional prototype implementation of a PUF-based cryptographic key generator, demonstrating the full benefit of using PUFs and the efficiency of the introduced processing techniques.},

We argue that a complex integrated circuit can be viewed as a silicon PUF and describe a technique to identify and authenticate individual integrated circuits (ICs).We describe several possible circuit realizations of different PUFs. These circuits have been implemented in commodity Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We present experiments which indicate that reliable authentication of individual FPGAs can be performed even in the presence of significant environmental variations.We describe how secure smart cards can be built, and also briefly describe how PUFs can be applied to licensing and certification applications.},
