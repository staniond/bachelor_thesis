    abstract="In the first part of this chapter, the author discusses all the security-related qualities attributed to PUF constructions over time and investigates to what extent these are inherent PUF-related properties, or merely advantages of one particular type of PUF. An unambiguous definition for each of the discussed properties is presented, and a comparative study on a representative subset of PUF proposals identifies the truly PUF-defining characteristics. The second part of this chapter presents the details of a very formal framework for describing PUFs and related physical primitives in a cryptographic manner. This allows cryptographers to use PUFs more easily as building blocks in theoretical constructions, while simultaneously enabling hardware designers and engineers to build constructions which actually comply with this framework.",

    abstract = {We introduce the notion of a Physical Random Function (PUF). We argue that a complex integrated circuit can be viewed as a silicon PUF and describe a technique to identify and authenticate individual integrated circuits (ICs).We describe several possible circuit realizations of different PUFs. These circuits have been implemented in commodity Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). We present experiments which indicate that reliable authentication of individual FPGAs can be performed even in the presence of significant environmental variations.We describe how secure smart cards can be built, and also briefly describe how PUFs can be applied to licensing and certification applications.},
